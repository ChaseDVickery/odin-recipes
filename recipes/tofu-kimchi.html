        <h1>Tofu and Cabbage Stew</h1>

        <img class="image recipe" src="../images/tofu-kimchi.jpg" alt="A bowl with tofu and kimchi stew.">
        <p>This is some kind of tofu and cabbage stew that I modified (slightly) from a tofu and kimchi recipe because I'm lazy and couldn't easily get kimchi for cheap. Hard to go wrong with this one, too- just keep adding stuff in over time and you should be good to go.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegatable oil</li>
            <li>6+ green onions</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>3 tbsp gochujang</li>
            <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>Kimchi (preferred) or some cabbage (pre-sliced coleslaw mix works well, too)</li>
            <li>1 block of tofu</li>
            <li>Mushrooms (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot on high, then add the white parts of the onion, garlic, and ginger for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add broth, cabbage, soy sauce, and gochujang. Mix it in.</li>
            <li>Get it to a simmer and cook about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add tofu and mushrooms and cook another 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle leftover green onions on top.</li>
            <li>Serve on rice if you need it to last, or top it with a fried egg.</li>
        </ol>
