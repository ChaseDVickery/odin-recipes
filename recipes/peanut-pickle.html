        <h1>Peanut Butter Pickle Sandwich</h1>

        <p>If you are reading this, I'm sorry. This meal is for when I hit rock bottom, and there is somehow no way to do it wrong. Does it matter what kind of peanut butter you use? No, I use crunchy. Does it matter what kind of pickle you use? No, you have already chosen defeat. Does it matter what kind of bread you use? No, it could be anything from white bread to a corn tortilla. Hell, shove this in a microwaved potato and it would probably still work. If you are here, you have given up for the day.</p>
